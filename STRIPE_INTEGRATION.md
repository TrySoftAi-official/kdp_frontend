# Stripe Elements Integration

This document describes the Stripe Elements integration implemented in the ForgeKDP frontend.

## Overview

The payment system has been upgraded from manual form handling to use Stripe Elements, providing a more secure and user-friendly payment experience.

## Components

### 1. StripeProvider (`src/components/providers/StripeProvider.tsx`)
- Wraps the application with Stripe Elements context
- Configures Stripe appearance and options
- Handles client secret management

### 2. StripePaymentForm (`src/components/payment/StripePaymentForm.tsx`)
- Renders Stripe Elements for payment collection
- Includes PaymentElement, LinkAuthenticationElement, and AddressElement
- Handles payment confirmation and error states

### 3. useStripePayment Hook (`src/hooks/useStripePayment.ts`)
- Manages PaymentIntent creation
- Handles client secret state
- Provides error handling for payment operations

## Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51S0JBpK7kz04pjzEc3eeBjhd7s0AaAbMKiWkMtcbxMrAV7GUM62CcRXW8FGtgeoFJKN8f7vUnGvphJbcSBoDlpvp00hc3eU1Co
```

## Features

- Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)
- Google Pay
- Apple Pay
- Klarna (Buy Now Pay Later)

### Security Features

- Encrypted payment data
- Secure tokenization
- 3D Secure authentication

### User Experience

## Usage

The CheckoutModal component now uses Stripe Elements instead of manual form handling:

```tsx
<StripeProvider clientSecret={clientSecret}>
  <StripePaymentForm
    amount={selectedPlan?.price || 0}
    currency="USD"
    planName={selectedPlan?.name || ''}
    billingCycle={selectedBillingCycle}
    onSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
    onError={handlePaymentError}
    onCancel={handlePaymentCancel}
    isProcessing={isProcessing}
    setIsProcessing={setIsProcessing}
  />
</StripeProvider>
```

## Backend Integration

The frontend creates PaymentIntents through the backend API:

```typescript
const clientSecret = await createPaymentIntent({
  amount: selectedPlan.price,
  currency: 'USD',
  planName: selectedPlan.name,
  billingCycle: selectedBillingCycle,
  planId: selectedPlan.plan_id,
  triggerSource,
  requiredFeature
});
```

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Ensure the Stripe publishable key is set in your environment
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the subscription page
4. Select a plan and proceed to payment
5. Use Stripe test card numbers for testing

### Test Card Numbers
- Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- 3D Secure: 4000 0025 0000 3155

## Migration Notes

The following changes were made during migration:

1. **Removed manual form handling** - No more manual card number, expiry, CVV inputs
2. **Added Stripe Elements** - Secure, PCI-compliant payment collection
3. **Updated payment flow** - Now uses PaymentIntent instead of CheckoutSession
